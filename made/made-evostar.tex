\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Our present work defines and tests a system that uses multi-paradigm three-layered architecture, where a Genetic algorithm optimizes the parameters of a virtual words in order to deduce complex logical predicates related to a popular literary pattern called the monomyth. The present section defines and explains the state-of-the-art researches regarding those concepts.

Non-player characters (NPC for further references) usually interact with the main player in order to challenge them, offer information to complete their goals or provide life-likeness to a virtual world. Following Szymanezyk et al. in \cite{szymanezyk2011individual}, crowds of NPCs enhance the game-play experience of open-world videogames. that are objective-oriented and open-landscaped videogames, following the classification by \cite{aarseth2005hunt}, where a player can roam freely through a virtual world. 

Open worlds are usually created using Procedural Content Generation (PGC) techniques. Recently, PCG is boosting its popularity, mainly due to two reasons: the cost reduction that the automatic generation implies to the developers, and the re-playability that it offers to the players. As a recent example, \textit{No man's sky}, an indie adventure videogame where planets, fauna and flora are created procedurally, won three Game Critics Awards, including Best Original Game and the Special Commendation for Innovation, in the past Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014, a reference annual trade show for the video game industry\footnote{\url{http://www.gamecriticsawards.com/winners.html}}.

Szymanezyk et al. in \cite{szymanezyk2011individual} remark that virtual humans composing a crowd are often modeled only in terms of individuals and that research in crowd behavior identifies that a large majority of persons in real crowds do not act in individualistic terms. Characters need to explore a social network in order to augment their believability and, as simulated crowds, need to consider group aspects, hence they propose to create a network-type data structure with the help of on-going sociology work.
The different inter-relations between the NPCs generate events and the goal of our research is to use those events to generate quality backstories for the NPCs, that are an important part of the game narrative, as defined by Bateman et al. in \cite{bateman2007game}:

Backstories are the histories leading up to the events of the game, and they give the player the information they need to immerse themselves in the fiction. Since backstories are relevant for the immersion of the game, in this research we create them massively using social interactions between the NPCs.

Archetypes are recurring thematic and linguistic patterns in folklore and literature \cite{garry2005archetypes}. In videogames, archetypes are classically related to the nature of the characters (for example, thief, warrior or wizard), which reminds of the concept of stereotype, the unfair belief that all people or things with a particular characteristic are the same. From our point of view, an archetype is a role that a character plays on a given moment or period, regardless of the nature of characteristics of them. Following this reasoning, a character could play many different archetypes in their life, even at the same time. But, what could be the minimum set of archetypes to design if we want to create interesting backstories? We found a good answer in the monomyth.

The monomyth, commonly known as the hero's journey, is a pattern where different archetypes behave in a specific way and conform to ancient and modern myths from cultures all over the world: It is the story of someone who is considered a hero, that has to deal with his/her shadow, who is waiting at the end of a journey, where different characters appear like mentors, allies or obstacles. The monomyth was studied by Joseph Campbell in The Hero with a Thousand Faces~\cite{campbell2008hero}, and later by Vogler in The writer's journey~\cite{vogler2007writer}. The monomyth has been typically applied to literature and traditional media, but it actually manifests also in modern videogames like Mass Effect or Skyrim \cite{knopf2013rationalist} among others. In videogames, the \textit{monomyth} is used to design the main plots that the player can empathize with: In his work \cite{bartle2004massively}, Bartle identifies and examines the application of key elements of the monomyth to videogames, and discovers that players play virtual worlds as a mean for self-discovery, by subconsciously, following a predetermined path: the monomyth. Our work uses the monomyth as a frame for backstories in videogames, since it provides a basic but omnipresent set of high level behaviors that can be found in the daily life but also in the biggest adventures. We use the monomyth as metric of interest in order to promote the archetypes present in it.

Our research uses a virtual world inhabited by autonomous agents, but
the idea of using Agent-Based Models (ABM) of the world to generate
stories is not new, as remarked in previous works \cite{garcia2014my}
\cite{garciaortega2015how}, especially in the area of the interactive
drama. % double blind: anonimyze citations or make citations
       % impersonal - JJ
In 2002, the Virtual Storyteller \cite{theune2002virtual} used agents
that made up dialogue using techniques from improv theater, a plot
guide and a narrator. Our technique uses the same approach but there
is no plot guide. Instead, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) sets the
mood of the backstories created by finding 'archetypes'.  
Mei et al. created in 2005 a system called Thespian \cite{si2005thespian}, where the agents' personalities, their goals, are fitted so that they are motivated to perform according to the scripts. They use lookahead search in a decision-theoretic framework to determine the best way to achieve their goals and they are prepared to respond to the user interaction in a consistent way. Like Thespian, our work is also focused in the final script, not in modeling the agent's personality, but in our target application, open-world videogames, scripts are auto-generated in order to be re-playable.
In 2008, Peinado et al. studied in \cite{peinado2008revisiting} the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI), a cognitive model that reinforces narrative causality insofar as motivations and where beliefs are causal links that enrich characters. DBI is a theory that is starting to be considered a promising tool for modeling sophisticated characters, but it is not suitable for our research since we need to use more basic agents, easy to model and parametrize: As discussed by Sanchez and Lucas in \cite{sanchez2002exploring}, the analysis of relatively simple simulations using ABMs can, nonetheless, be quite complex, and in our case we use them in massively inhabited virtual worlds hard to analyze and evolve.

In previous works we used Finite State Machines (FSMs) to model the agent behavior, but FSMs and its variants have limitations in developing game Artificial Intelligence (AI), for this reason in our present research we have used Behavior Trees (BT) instead, following Lim's arguments in \cite{lim2009ai}: BTs simplify the design of behavior by allowing the re-usability of tasks without increasing the complexity of the nodes and transitions. Moreover, BTs are the most successful method to model AIs in videogames, and many game engines allow the possibility to create them, like Unity3D or Unreal Engine. A behavior tree consist of different kinds of tasks that are the nodes in a hierarchical structure, following the description by Trembley \cite{tremblay2012understanding}: conditions, that check properties of the environment, actions, that alter the state of the environment,  and compositions, whose result is calculated from the children tasks.

Our previous work proved that a hybrid
\textit{Evolutionary Computation - Agent Based Model} (EC-ABM)
methodology can be used to achieve the emergence of archetypes,
according to the structure studied by Cioffi et al. in
\cite{cioffi2012evolutionary}. Here we add a new
layer in charge of evaluating the backstories: The Logical
Reasoning (LR). We use an ABM for the execution of the virtual world,
whose execution is parameterized by a set of integer and float values,
a Logical Reasoner that evaluates the events generated by each
simulation and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to find the set of parameters
with highest fitness. The LR uses a mixed imperative-declarative
paradigm, following Denti's approach in \cite{denti2001tuprolog}  to
make high level deductions from the simulation's events, that are also
expressed as logical predicates, using a logical theory that is
modeled from the monomyth. The three layered architecture proposed can
be observed in figure~\ref{fig:3_layered}.

\section{A backstory generator that promotes the monomyth}

In this section we will present a system that uses the three-layered system EC-ABM-LR to generate and evaluate backstories in the virtual world. Firstly, in section \ref{sec:architecture}, we show the high level architecture of the system and the tasks assigned tof each logical module. Later, in section \ref{sec:abm} we give the details of the ABM layer including the virtual world, the agent's model, the parameterization of the simulation and the output format. Then, in section \ref{sec:lr}, we propose an implementation of the logical model of the monomyth, and a method to evaluate the quality of the backstories using logical reasoning on that model. Finally, in section \ref{sec:ec}, we argue the usage of a GA to promote the emergence of the monomyth.

\subsection{The system architecture}
\label{sec:architecture}

		\caption{Proposed components and data flow diagram of the whole architecture.}
		\label{fig:dataflow}
	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{high-level architecture of the system.}
\end{figure}

The proposed system is described in the Dataflow Diagram of figure \ref{fig:dataflow}. Different modules have been defined: The optimizer, the simulator, the reasoner, the narrator and the customizer. The Optimizer, formerly the EC layer, uses a GA whose individuals are simulation configurations and returns the best individual found. The fitness function of each individual consists in several simulations, performed by the Simulator, i.e. the ABM layer, that uses a multi-agent system in order to generate a sequence of events. These events are evaluated by the LR, the third layer, that uses predicate logic to assign a numerical value to the events following guidelines extracted from the monomyth. The Simulator runs the virtual environment with each configuration in different trials and returns the average (the fitness) to the Optimizer. On the other hand, the Narrator takes a given solution and transforms it to an agnostic narration, that is a selection of relevant predicates without final names for the narration elements. The Customizer is in charge of assigning names and structures to the agnostic narration in order to apply a specific literary setting, for example, middle-age, futuristic, steampunk or Shakespearian.


\subsection{ABM Layer: An agent-based model that generates simple events}
\label{sec:abm}

The virtual environment that we propose in this work is called
{\sf ColorForms}, and has been designed as a board-like game that focuses
in the four independent, ontic dimensions that conform the
ludo-narrative design space described by Aarseth in his work
\cite{aarseth2012narrative}: world, objects, agents and events. In our
virtual environment, pieces will compete and collaborate in order to
reach their desired colour. The narrative, as Aylett studied in
\cite{aylett1999narrative}, emerges through small interactions between
the characters. The main elements are described as follows:  

\begin{description}
	\item[{\bf World}]: Our backstories need spatio-temporal
          dimensions, namely, a place where they occur and a time that
          sequences and orders the events. In Colourforms, we propose
          to use a very simple map: the checkerboard, that consist of
          64 squares (8x8). The time is measured in virtual days. 
	\item[{\bf Agents}]: Our agents are pieces that can occupy one
          cell each. There are three shapes for the pieces (circle,
          square and triangle) and a zero-sum game relation between
          them, rock-paper-scissors alike, in order to establish a
          method to decide the winner and the loser in individual
          direct conflicts while keeping a global balance. Agents
          change along the timeline: every piece has a background
          color and a foreground color that are constantly
          modified. The background color varies randomly in a slowly
          way for every piece and represents the continuous internal
          changes in the character needs. The foreground color can be
          changed by the piece or by other pieces under certain
          circumstances and is used to improve the happiness: the
          piece is happier when the two colours are equal.  
	\item[{\bf Objects}]: We use one type of object the
          characters must compete or collaborate for: the color spot. In
          our environment, the agents can stain with the spot in order
          to become colored. The color spots  appear or disappear randomly. 
	\item[{\bf Events}]: The characters interact between them
          and the environment, although the number of actions is very
          limited: move to a free adjacent cell, push another agent to
          a  % push to a what? - JJ
depending on the shape, interchange the background color
          and stain with a color spot. 
\end{description}

As the we remarked in the introduction and following 
\cite{szymanezyk2011individual}, characters need to explore a social
network in order to augment their believability. The social component
is defined in {\sf ColorForm}s by an affinity matrix: Each piece has
an affinity with every other piece in the board, that will depend on
their shape, background and foreground colors. This affinity is
dynamic and will influence the decisions that piece makes; for
instance, the hapiness of the piece will be influenced by the ones with
high affinity with it. 

In our proposal, events are represented as logical predicates. Kim
\cite{kim1976events} theorized that the term 'event' usually implies a
change, and most changes are changes in a substance (an individual, an
object, a living thing or a system), that occur when 'it acquires a
property it did not previously have, or loses a property it previously
had'. Formerly, Kim defined the events in his theory of the structured
complexes using the canonical notation [x, P, t], where x is the
substance, P is the property it exemplifies and t is the time. The
existence condition implies that Event [x, P, t] exists just in case
that substance x has the property P at the time t. In our work, the
events that compound the backstories are defined as meaningful logical
predicates with notation Predicate (t, x\_0, /dots , x\_n) where t is
the time, and each x is an element of the world (a character, a cell,
a moment, the property of an element or a value). Each predicate has a
name, a signature (or arguments) and an interpretation, that is a
description of the event in natural language. 

Our current research contemplates two types of predicates: Those that
have been generated by the agents in the virtual environment (world's
facts, present in figure \ref{fig:predicates}) and those that are inferred using the Reasoner
module, related to the monomyth (world's deductions, present in figure
\ref{fig:theory}). White nodes in the figure represent the predicates
generable by the ABM layer, while the gray ones are inferred by the
Reasoner. The light gray nodes (called {\em helpers}) help to promote
the dark-gray predicates, or {\em facilitators}. These are the ones
that are present in the monomyth pattern, and they are interesting by
themselves. Therefore, the {\em monomyth} node implies the appearance
of all the {\em facilitators}. This node represent the `pure' literary
monomyth.

The virtual environment created for this work, the pieces (characters)
are emotion-driven and can perform different strategies to interact
with each other in order to generate events that will conform later
backstories. The behavior tree used, described in
figure~\ref{fig:bt_autogen}, has condition nodes and action nodes;
when a condition is fulfilled it generates an event from the figure~\ref{fig:predicates}.c and when an action is executed correctly it
generates an event from figure \ref{fig:predicates}.d. Our implementation
of behavior tree executes the tree in pre-order until a leaf node is
evaluated as 'success'. 

\begin{figure}[htb]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{bt_autogen.pdf}
	\caption{Proposed agents' behavior tree: Circular nodes represent conditions and rectangular nodes represent actions.)}
	\label{fig:bt_autogen}
\end{figure}

The Simulator takes an array of 52 values as input, maps them to the environment internal variables and performs the execution of the virtual world by running sequentially the parametrized agents' behavior tree. Finally, when a specific number of virtual days is reached, the simulation finishes and the generated events are sent to the Reasoner for further analysis. The structure of the configuration array and the meaning of each element are described in figure~\ref{fig:abm_parameters}. As we will se in further sections, the configuration array of the Reasoner will be the chromosome in the Optimizer, in other words, the individual of the GA.

\subsection{LR layer: Logical reasoning to construct the monomyth}
\label{sec:lr}

As remarked in section~\ref{sec:intro}, the monomyth is a pattern that conforms the quintessence of heroism in literature and is composed of different archetypes. Vogler in \cite{vogler2007writer} encountered that archetypes are not 'rigid character roles' but 'flexible character functions' performed to achieve certain effects in the story, hence the same character can play different archetypes along a story.
'There are, of course, many more archetypes; as many as there are human qualities to dramatize in stories', but we will focus in the eight archetypes that conform the monomyth:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The \textbf{Hero} is willing to sacrifice his own needs on behalf of others.
	\item The \textbf{Mentor} teaches and protects heroes and gives them gifts.
	\item The \textbf{Threshold} Guardians are the the forces that the hero must overcome.
	\item The \textbf{Herald} is the caller to the adventure for the hero.
	\item The \textbf{Shapeshifter} changes (of archetype) along the journey.
	\item The \textbf{Shadow} is the villain or antagonist; the dark side.
	\item The \textbf{Ally} accompanies or helps the hero through the journey.
	\item The \textbf{Trickster} is a mischief-makers.
\end{enumerate}

In our approach, we have taken the archetypes that conform the
monomyth and tried to define them in terms of the world's events
described in section~\ref{sec:abm}. The Reasoner uses a logical theory
in PROLOG, that is a powerful approach since it gives us the
possibility to compound predicates and use time-frameworks. The terms
in our theory are shown in figure~\ref{fig:theory} in an ordered way
following a dependency graph. The archetypes and other needed concepts
are as follows: 
%
\begin{figure}[htb]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{theory.pdf}
	\caption{Predicate dependencies in the proposed logical theory of the monomyth: White nodes represent predicates generable by the ABM layer and gray predicates (helpers) are inferred by the Reasoner. Dark-gray predicates (facilitators) conform the monomyth.}
	\label{fig:theory}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Conflict} is a sequence of events that succeed
          in a certain moment where two characters take part (the
          winner and the loser). In the {\sf ColorForm}s game, a
          conflict might appear when a piece scares or displaces
          other, or when they takes a color spot that the other
          desires. If two pieces are friends and one of them is displaced by a third one, the two friends have a conflict with it.
	\item The \textbf{Journey} is the interval between conflicts
          between two characters. The first conflict must be lost by
          one of them (the \textbf{Hero}) and the second one has to be
          lost by the other (the \textbf{Shadow}), who must be 'more
          evil' than the Hero, that is, have helped less friends. 
	\item A \textbf{Mentor} is a character that is a friend of the Hero during the Journey and helps them at least once. 
	\item The \textbf{Threshold Guardian} will be defeated by the hero along the journey. 
	\item A \textbf{Herald} is a friend of the hero in a Journey that has the initiator conflict.
	\item An \textbf{Ally} helps the Hero in a Journey, either
          giving the Hero an extra turn to accomplish their goals or
          going along the Hero physically along the journey.
	\item A \textbf{Shapeshifter} will play the Ally and the
          Threshold Guardian archetypes in the same Journey. 
	\item The \textbf{Trickster} is a character that accompanies
          the Hero along the Journey joking and turning tricks. In our
          implementation, to be trickier tan other can imply to have
          more joy than them.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{EC layer: Genetic algorithms for the archetypes emergence}
\label{sec:ec}

% Why do we use GA??

As previously explained, the objective of our work is to generate the archetypes present in the monomyth. Since we have to deal with a big amount of parameters and the result of the simulator in uncertain, due the stochastic nature of the virtual world and the unpredictable inter-relationships of the agents, the usage of a GA is proposed. This technique has been proved to work successfully in these kind of environments by A and B in C and D respectivelly. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{abm_parameters.pdf}
	\caption{Configuration array of the reasoner (ABM layer) and structure of the individual of the Optimizer (EC layer). Gray rectangles stand for the index of the parameters.}
	\label{fig:abm_parameters}
\end{figure}

% What is a GA?

GAs are a subset of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), which are a set of
bio-inspired techniques applied to optimization problems
\cite{eiben2010whatis}. 
%% , based on the process of natural selection
%% \cite{darwin1859}. In this kind of algorithms, a \textsc{population}
%% of codified solutions (called \textsc{individuals}) is created. The
%% most adapted individuals have more chances to be selected for
%% reproduction, so their offspring could inherit their genetic
%% material. The level of adaptation of each solution is measured using a
%% \textsc{fitness} function, that usually models the problem to
%% solve. GAs were proposed by Holland \cite{holland1975adaptation}, and
%% also studied by Goldberg \cite{goldberg1988genetic} and Michalewicz
%% \cite{michalewicz1996genetic}. In this kind of EA, the representation
%% of the solution is a string of numbers, called \textsc{chromosome}
%% (and sometimes \textsc{genome}). The individuals are selected
%% proportionally to their fitness, and then \textsc{recombination}
%% and/or \textsc{mutation} are applied to generate new individuals that
%% will be introduced in the population. These algorithms have been used
%% in different areas, such as function optimization
%% \cite{michalewicz1996genetic}, combinatorial optimization
%% \cite{Esparcia2009EVITA}, artificial intelligence in videogames
%% \cite{Fernandez20111optimizing}, or generative art
%% \cite{Garcia2013RGB}, among others.  
%
The Optimizer module uses a GA to evolve configurations of the
Simulator in order to find the one with the best fitness, that is
calculated in base of the predicates found by the Reasoner. The use of
a GA is adequate since it is not possible to deduce the effects of the
parameter values when the agents interact: The fitness is the result
of high level interactions or specific sequences of them (phenotype)
that cannot be predicted. This uncertainty is increased by the
stochastic nature of the simulation, since different executions of the
simulator provide distinct results that improves the re-playability of
the videogame. 

An individual for our GA is a chromosome of 52 genes, where the first 5 are natural numbers in different ranges and the following 47 are real values in the range [0-1]. The structure of the chromosome is detailed in figure~\ref{fig:abm_parameters}.

We use a generational model, with selection by binary tournament and no elitism. Our mutation operator is polynomial and our crossover operator is \mbox{blx-$\alpha$}, both good elections when our genes are coded as numerical values. All these decision are supported by Eiben and Smith in their book \cite{eiben2010whatis}.

The fitness used takes into account the number of archetypes that have been deduced by the Reasoner since we are interested in the promotion of the monomyth, as described in section~\ref{sec:lr}.


Let
$A_i$ an archetype in the set of all $T$ desired predicates $A$:
\begin{multline}
A = \{Conflict, Journey, Shadow, Hero, Mentor, Herald, Guardian,\\
Allied, Trickster, Shapeshifter, Monomyth\}
\end{multline}
and $|A_{i}|$ the number of occurrences of that predicate generated by the Reasoner at the end of the simulation, we define the next three metrics to evaluate the fitness $F$:

\begin{itemize}
\item Amount of Monomyth Occurrences Found ($M$): Count the number of occurrences of the predicate 'monomyth', hence it stands for the most basic metric we can implement.
\begin{equation}
F_{M} = \left| A_{Monomyth}\right|
\label{eq:M}
\end{equation}


\item Amount of All Occurrences Found ($A$): Count the number of occurrences of every monomyth-implication predicate in the simulation, defined as `facilitators' in Section \ref{sec:lr}, and also shown as dark-gray nodes in figure~\ref{fig:theory}.
\begin{equation}
F_{A} = \sum _{i=0}^{T}\left| A_{i}\right|
\label{eq:A}
\end{equation}

\item Amount of All Ocurrences Distributed by Predicates ($AD$): Counts the number of occurrences, but promotes the appearance of new archetypes. That is, the occurrence of two different predicates gets a bigger fitness than two occurrences of the same predicate. 
\begin{equation}
F_{AD} = \sum _{i=0}^{T} \log _{10} (\left|A_{i}\right| + 1)
\label{eq:AD}
\end{equation}

\end{itemize}

Although our goal is to make the monomyth emerge, and this can be achieved with fitness metric $M$ (equation ~\ref{eq:M}), we have added the extra metrics defined in equations \ref{eq:A} and \ref{eq:AD} to observe the effects of guiding the evolution by promoting the appearance of the facilitators.

More complicated metrics could be chosen, for example, using human interaction as proposed by Takagi in \cite{Takagi2001}, but the chosen ones can be considered the simplest ones to detect the emergence of the monomyth.

% Qué queremos hacer? demostrar que podemos hacer que surja el monomito y de paso si las métricas seleccionadas son adecuadas

The objective of this paper is to demonstrate that it is possible to create a multi-paradigm three-layered system (AC-LR-ABM) that is able to generate massive backstories following the monomyth guidelines. As secondary objectives, we try to test if the chosen metrics are valid to allow the emergence in the evolutionary process of the GA.

\section{Conclusions}

% este trabajo presenta...

The present paper uses agent-based modeling, logical reasoning and
genetic algorithms to promote the appearance of massive backstories
that can later be used in 
 videogames with archetypes that follow the monomyth
guidelines. For this, we model emotion-driven autonomous agents that
interact in a virtual world called {\sf ColorForm} where color pieces
compete and collaborate in order to change their colors. The virtual
environment generates events using logical predicates that are later
used by a PROLOG reasoner to deduce the different archetypes that
conforms the monomyth. Finally, a genetic algorithm is used to
optimize the configuration of the virtual world. We have compared
three different fitnesses in order to guide the evolutionary process.

Experiments show that the emergence of the monomyth can be improved by
searching facilitators, in other words, the predicates that are found
in the monomyth, instead of just focusing in the number of monomyth
occurrences. Moreover, rewarding the diversity of archetypes leads to
better solutions. Results demonstrate that it is possible to make the
monomyth emerge and massively generate backstories populated with
archetypes that are proved emotionally engaging for the videogame
player.
